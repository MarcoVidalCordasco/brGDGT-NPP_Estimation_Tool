# brGDGT-NPP_Estimation_Tool
This interactive tool estimates terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) from branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) and/or 
climate variables. It implements a Random Forest model trained on global brGDGT–NPP calibrations and supports optional 
HANPP computation.
 
Features
•	brGDGT–derived NPP prediction (with uncertainty)
•	Climate-derived NPP (Miami model)
•	Human appropriation of NPP (HANPP)
•	Plot and summary statistics export
•	Excel output
